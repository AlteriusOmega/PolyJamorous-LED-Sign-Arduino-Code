# PolyJamorous-LED-Sign-Arduino-Code

This is the Arduino C code for the addressable LED sign for the Burning Man / Flipside camp PolyJamorous. This is what the Sign looks like!

The code includes many intricate animations, including many which use specific letters. I created a custom struct which uses the CRGBSet class from the FastLED library. This allows specific letters to be controlled separately. There are also many animations that use specific color schemes, gradients, and motion to create dynamic and visually-engaging patterns.
